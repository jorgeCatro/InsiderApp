# Dynamic Detection Model

This project is part of my Master's Thesis (TFM) and implements a dynamic detection model using Python. The application is designed to detect and classify objects in real-time, adapting to new data over time. This repository contains the source code, documentation, and resources needed to run and understand the model.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. *Clone the repository*:

    bash
    git clone https://github.com/.....git
    cd dynamic-detection-model
    

2. *Create and activate a virtual environment* (optional but recommended):

    bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    

3. *Install the required dependencies*:

    bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    

4. *Download the model weights* (if applicable):

    - Ensure you have the pre-trained model weights in the models/ directory, or follow instructions to train your model.

## Usage


Once the setup is complete, you can run the application with the following command:

```bash
python python InsiderApp.py



## Execution

git clone https://github.com/tu-usuario/insider-risk-evaluator.git
cd insider-risk-evaluator
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
